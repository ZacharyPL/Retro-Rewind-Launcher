Simple ZIP Library - Minizip

This sample uses a modified version of Minizip (by Gilles Vollant), 
a lightweight zlib extension.
It extracts the entire contents of test.zip into test, creating folders as
it goes. It uses standard C file functions. ioapi.c can be modified easily 
to allow for alternate usage (eg: DVD or SMB).
